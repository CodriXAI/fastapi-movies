## Project Overview

The Movies API is a **CRUD** service that stores a catalogue of films in an inâ€‘memory list (for now). It was built to explore **FastAPI** fundamentals such as routing, model validation, automatic documentation, and modular project organisation.

---

## Project Goals

- Gain handsâ€‘on experience with **FastAPI** and asynchronous Python.
- Practise clean architecture by separating **routers**, **models**, and **business logic**.
- Learn to document an API using **Markdown** + the autoâ€‘generated **Swagger UI**.
- Apply good DevOps habits: virtual environments, `requirements.txt`, environment variables, and automated tests.

## Tech Stack & Key Libraries

| Purpose          | Library                | Why it matters                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Web framework    | **FastAPI**            | Typeâ€‘hinted, asyncâ€‘ready, automatic docs    |
| Data validation  | **Pydantic v2**        | Declarative schemas & runtime validation    |
| ASGI server      | **Uvicorn**            | Productionâ€‘grade server with hotâ€‘reload     |
| Typing           | **mypy** (optional)    | Static type checking                        |

## Dependency Injection

FastAPIâ€™s `Depends` mechanism wires common resources (e.g. DB sessions, auth checks) into endpoints. Even though this app only uses an inâ€‘memory list, the pattern is demonstrated so the code can later migrate to a real database seamlessly:

```python
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException

def get_db():
    return fake_db  # swap with real session later

@router.get("/movies")
async def list_movies(db = Depends(get_db)):
    return db
```

## Modular Routers

Endpoints are grouped by feature into **APIRouters**. This keeps each file short and composable:

```python
# app/routers/movies.py
router = APIRouter(prefix="/movies", tags=["movies"])
```

Routers are included in `main.py`:

```python
app.include_router(movies.router)
```

---

## Running Locally
### 1.Â Clone & enter repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/fastapi-movies.git
cd fastapi-movies
```

### 2. Create venv & install deps

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## HTTP Endpoints

### Summary

```
GET     /movies           â†’ List all movies
GET     /movies/{id}      â†’ Retrieve one movie
POST    /movies           â†’ Create a new movie
PUT     /movies/{id}      â†’ Replace entire movie
DELETE  /movies/{id}      â†’ Remove movie
```

### Error Responses

- `404 Not Found` â€“ movieâ€¯ID does not exist
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` â€“ request body fails Pydantic validation
- `500 Internal Server Error` â€“ unhandled exceptions (should never happen in happy path)

---

## Validation & Constraints

Pydantic schemas enforce data types and custom rules:

```python
class Movie(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(min_length=1)
    year: int = Field(ge=1888, le=datetime.now().year)  # first film was 1888
    genre: str = Field(..., description="Main genre")
```

---

## Error Handling Strategy

All domainâ€‘specific errors are translated into **HTTPException** instances with meaningful status codes and messages. A global exception handler could be added for logging and sanitising unhandled errors.

---

## Learnings & Key Takeaways

- **FastAPI** makes async API development approachable and efficient.
- **APIRouter** promotes clean modularisation.
- Type hints + **Pydantic** reduce runtime bugs by catching bad payloads early.
- Automatic docs (SwaggerÂ UI / ReDoc) save manual effort and impress stakeholders.
- Separating config with **BaseSettings** keeps code 12â€‘factorâ€‘app friendly.
- Writing tests with **httpx.AsyncClient** let me verify behaviour without spinning a server.
- Keeping secrets out of the repo via **dotenv** is essential for security.
- Clear docs like this file turn a simple exercise into a portfolioâ€‘ready project.

## About Uvicorn
To call the application, I will use the **uvicorn main:app** command:
   
    bash
    uvicorn <namefile>:<application>

If I want **to change the port**, I must add to the original command:
    
    bash
    uvicorn <namefile>:<application> --port <port>

If I want the code changes to take effect **when the page is reloaded**, add:
    
    bash
    uvicorn <namefile>:<application> --port <port> --reload

If I want **other devices to be able to access it locally**, then the command would be:
   
    bash
    uvicorn <namefile>:<application> --host 0.0.0.0 --port <port> --reload

**Regarding Modularizations:**

If the file I want to access is in a different path than where I call it:
    
    bash
    uvicorn <directory>.<namefile>:<application> --port <port> --reload

## Conclusion

*While this project is basic, I believe it has laid the foundation for me to understand how an API works at an introductory level. I would like to give it a deeper understanding of AI so I can continue my education.*
